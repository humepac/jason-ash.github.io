          <p>The original Monty Hall Show featured three doors, two goats, and a brand new car. Contestants choose a door, Monty reveals a goat behind another door, and contestants are offered the chance to switch their original choice. After heated debate among probability nerds, it was eventually agreed that switching is the optimal strategy, which wins two out of three games. In this week's Riddler, we examine a variation of this game in which the number of goats is random. Does it change the decision to switch?</p>

          <p>I'm announcing a new personal project, called pyesg - Python Economic Scenario Generator. Economic Scenario Generators, or ESGs, are used to simulate possible future markets, like stock prices, interest rates, or volatilities. Actuaries use ESGs to determine the potential values of insurance portfolios in the future. This helps them ensure that their companies will have enough money to pay claims even under the worst scenarios. Other professionals might use ESGs to understand how business decisions today could affect company value in the future. The Python ecosystem has amazing libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and many other fields, but not for generating economic scenarios. I hope that an ESG library for Python will make this type of analysis easier and more widely adopted.</p>

          <p>This week's fivethirtyeight riddler was created by yours truly! It was the first puzzle I've submitted to the riddler, and I hope you enjoyed it. This week we attempt to fool a bank with counterfeit hundred dollar bills.</p>

          <p>Based on an actual statistical analysis problem from World War II, this week's Riddler asks us to estimate the population of German tanks given uncertain information about the tanks we've observed. Fortunatley, despite the uncertainty in our observations, we can still provide reasonably accurate estimates for the total German tank population. We'll rely heavily on Bayesian analysis to solve this problem.</p>
